# What si CountOnMe ?

CountOnMe is an OpenClassrooms assignment. It aims at learning to improve a code base and to write unit tests with [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest): 

The original code base is there : https://github.com/AmbroiseCollon/ZozorPlus.git. 

And here is a sample of the README:

> This repository is the base code for [this project](https://openclassrooms.com/projects/ameliorer-une-application-existante) on openclassrooms.com.
> It's part of OpenClassrooms' iOS path which can be found here.

> # ZozorPlus
>
> Students are supposed to clone or fork the repo and improve it. Their focus should be on the following aspects :
>
> - Responsiveness
> - MVC compliance
> - Tests
> - Bonus feature



# Bonus

Unit tests automation with jenkins and fastlane.

[The pdf file Bonus_Integration_Continue](https://github.com/t8lv4/CountOnMe/blob/master/Bonus_Integration_Continue.pdf) is a step by step description (in french) of a jenkins and fastlane set up. This CI system is deployed locally on macOS 10.13.6.

By the end of this set up we will be able to run tests automatically. If a build fails, we will be able to open a Github issue.
